## A Beginners Guide to Tracking with Siamese Neural Networks


You're sitting on your couch, dog at your feet, one hand completely immersed in a bag of white cheddar Smartfood. Netflix is on the box and you're just passing minute 48 of the imdb rated 6.4/10, thriller Surveillance. You watch as the main character tries to evade the watching eye of the police. As they pore over endless frames of cctv, following every move of the antagonist. You cant help but think. They can't actually do this, can they? The answer to that question is yes, _they_ absolutely can and they will. One way they could do this is using Siamese neural networks.
This article isn't going to make Elon Musk and you may not come out of with a fully functioning prototype but by the end you will understand exactly how these networks are able to achieve such spooky results.
Assumed is a basic knowledge of convolutional neural networks and the math behind them. If you don't have that I recommend saving this tab and watching this video, then coming back
